README.md for Photography for Beginners Website, by Rachel Lawson. Student number L3007866 at South Staffordshire College.

Hi User, Welcome to my README.md for 'Photography for Beginners' website, I hope you enjoy using the site and it makes you want to pick up a Camera.

This webpage explains the basics a beginner photographer would need to know when starting their journey in Photography. 

The website has four pages, these are: Index/Home, Taking a Photo, Portfolio and Book a Lesson.

Index/Home Page:
This page has a few main features. I wanted the design to be simple and not distracting to the user, especially as the website aim is for beginner photographers who just need basic information so they can take a photo, plus also access to be able to sign up to Photography lessons.

The page consists of a navigation bar to enable users to easily navigate around the site at their greatest convinience and leisure. To the left of the Navigation bar is my site logo "Photography for Beginners' I love how simple and elegant it looks and not too distracting!

There is a photo of a woman taking a photo, I purposely chose a female Photographer as there is still a lot more men in Photography than Women, so I wanted to encourage Women that they can do it too. 

My vision section is important as it explains my vision with the Photography website, lessons available and the studio (studio isn't actually a real studio yet (highly expensive to run), so I haven't put an address on for that reason)!  I also really like the pale blue colour as it isn't too distracting, but breaks up the white a bit without too much colour! I love a white background as I find it too distracting with lots of colours and photos on a background.

The Photography lessons schedule details the lessons available, the times and the locations.  When you navigate to the book a lesson page, it asks you to type in which lesson(s) you are looking for.  Each div has The details needed, a nice fontawesome logo picture to represent better what it is. The background image is of a camera set up to take a landscpape Photograph.

The Footer section has links to social media pages, these include Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. If this was for a real Photography lesson site then these would all link to actual Photography Studio social media sites. 

Taking a Photo page:
This page also has the logo and Navigation at the top.
It has the main aim of teaching a beginner Photographer how to take their first Photo. 

There is a brief taking a photo section.

Next there is a photo of a woman taking a photo, this aids the visuality of the website and breaks up the text a bit, without being too distracting.

The section on the Exposure triangle gives a basic explaination on what it is and how it helps. 

The diagram image is mine I made based on the standard Exposure Triangles. 

Then there is a Take a Photo - Step by Step Guide. This is made up in boxes that are easy to read and similar to index page to give a consistent flow to the user. 

The same Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Portfolio page:
The Portfolio page is a selection of different types of Photographs. 
I wanted a range of genres to show beginner Photographers different genres and styles they can do themselves.  There is a mix of stock photos and my own Photography photos which I hold the copyright to my own images.

The same Navigation, logo are on this page too.

The Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Book a Lesson page:
The Book a Lesson page is where the user can book a lesson and/or get in touch via phone and email (fake number and email address used for this). 

The booking form consists of the main fields of information necessary for booking a lesson: First name, Last name, Email address and a Lesson request field where they can enter the lesson they want etcs. Then a submit button. If this was a live website for a Photographer offering lessons, then the form would go to the email address via a database system, as I understand. However this form just goes to the Code Institue Form dump it said to use. 

The Get in Touch div just contains a phone number and email address, as explained above these are fake just for the purpose of the course.

The boxes I used are the pale blue colouring again, I used this throughout the website as I felt it is simple yet elegant and not distracting away from the main purpose of the website.

The Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Responsive Design -
Responsive design is used throught the website to make it easier for the user when viewing the site on different devices, such as 4K screen, PC, Large Laptop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile and more. 

Credits/References - 
The Photographs used are from three main sources:
Myself - Rachel Lawson, I own the copyright to these images, so nobody can use these without my written permisson, (bird.jpg, checked.jpg, einstein-bird.jpg, elle-hand.jpg, wildlife.jpg, yellow.jpg). 
My partner Steve Hawkes Photography has also provided me with one image and the same copyright applies to his images(street-male.jpg).
The other images were free stock images that were copyright free from www.pexels.com

No Bootstrap or similar were used to code this website as I'd started coding the website when going through the HTML and CSS Sections and then added a little part similar to when learning the Love Running Project, as this worked well with the information I wanted to have on my website - it is purposely simple and non distracting, as the website is for beginners so it doesn't need to overly complicate anything! Plus the main purpose is to get someone to take their first photos and to book a lesson if they want to learn more. 

Any issues/bugs/WS3 CSS Validation-

Extra information/Anything I would add if developing the website further -

Thank you for spending the time looking at my README.md and my Website. I appreciate it. Hopefully you have a go at Photography too; I've been doing Photography for just under a year now and it's amazing fun, really recommend it. It's a great way to create Art, meet new people, experience new places and wildlife too.

Best Regards,
Rachel Lawson
