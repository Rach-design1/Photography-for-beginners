README.md for Photography for Beginners Website, by Rachel Lawson. Student number L3007866 at South Staffordshire College.

Hi User, Welcome to my README.md for 'Photography for Beginners' website. I hope you enjoy using the site and it makes you want to pick up a Camera.

The website has four pages, these are: Index/Home, Taking a Photo, Portfolio and Book a Lesson.

User Story:
The User Story of this website is that the user will learn the basics of Photographer to take their first Photo and to then enquire about a lesson, if they would like to, not everyone does like lessons as some just want to take photos as a hobby on their own. The User Story is provided in further details, page by page below.

Index/Home Page:
This page has a few main features. I wanted the design to be simple and not distracting to the user, especially as the website aim is for beginner photographers who just need basic information so they can take a photo, plus also access to be able to sign up to Photography lessons.

The page consists of a navigation bar to enable users to easily navigate around the site at their greatest convenience and leisure. To the left of the Navigation bar is my site logo "Photography for Beginners' I love how simple and elegant it looks and not too distracting!

There is a photo of a woman taking a photo, I purposely chose a female Photographer as there is still a lot more men in Photography than Women, so I wanted to encourage Women that they can do it too. 

My vision section is important as it explains my vision with the Photography website, lessons available and the studio (studio isn't actually a real studio yet (highly expensive to run), so I haven't put an address on for that reason)!  I also really like the pale blue colour as it isn't too distracting but breaks up the white a bit without too much colour! I love a white background as I find it too distracting with lots of colours and photos on a background.

The Photography lessons schedule details the lessons available, the times and the locations.  When you navigate to the book a lesson page, it asks you to type in which lesson(s) you are looking for.  Each div has the details needed, a nice fontawesome logo picture to represent better what it is. The background image is of a camera set up to take a landscape Photograph.

The Footer section has links to social media pages, these include Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. If this was for a real Photography lesson site then these would all link to actual Photography Studio social media sites. 

Taking a Photo page:
This page also has the logo and Navigation at the top.
It has the main aim of teaching a beginner Photographer how to take their first Photo. 

There is a brief taking a photo section.

Next there is a photo of a woman taking a photo, this aids the visuality of the website and breaks up the text a bit, without being too distracting.

The section on the Exposure triangle gives a basic explanation on what it is and how it helps. 

The diagram image is mine I made based on the standard Exposure Triangles. 

Then there is a Take a Photo - Step by Step Guide. This is made up in boxes that are easy to read and similar to index page to give a consistent flow to the user. 

The same Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Portfolio page:
The Portfolio page is a selection of different types of Photographs. 
I wanted a range of genres to show beginner Photographers different genres and styles they can do themselves.  There is a mix of stock photos and my own Photography photos which I hold the copyright to my own images.

The same Navigation, logo are on this page too.

The Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Book a Lesson page:
The Book a Lesson page is where the user can book a lesson and/or get in touch via phone and email (fake number and email address used for this). 

The booking form consists of the main fields of information necessary for booking a lesson: First name, Last name, Email address and a Lesson request field where they can enter the lesson they want etcs. Then a submit button. If this was a live website for a Photographer offering lessons, then the form would go to the email address via a database system, as I understand. However this form just goes to the Code Institute Form dump it said to use. 

The Get in Touch div just contains a phone number and email address, as explained above these are fake just for the purpose of the course.

The boxes I used are the pale blue colouring again, I used this throughout the website as I felt it is simple yet elegant and not distracting away from the main purpose of the website.

The Footer section is on this page with the social media links.

Responsive Design -
Responsive design is used through the website to make it easier for the user when viewing the site on different devices, such as 4K screen, PC, Large Laptop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile and more. 
These were made using Media Queries and a lot of researching different options online and some choice words at times!! This was rather frustrating as you'd think fantastic it's worked, then something else would rear its ugly head at you! I tried my best and in life that's all you can do is your best and see it as an opportunity for learning and growth. This is an area I would like to develop a greater understanding of further outside of this website project. 

Testing - I tested the website on Mac myself, I don't have the financial option to buy a Windows computer too, but luckily my sister let me send her the link to test on her Windows computer.  It has been tested mainly through Google Chrome browser and Safari Browser. Having issues downloading the firefox browser on the Macbook so haven't tested on that yet. Have tested the site on mobile devices, don't have the finances to buy an ipad to personally test on one, but have tested it on DevTools tablet/ipad options. 

Any issues/bugs/WS3 CSS Validation/Chrome Developer Lighthouse -
Using Lighthouse on Developer (Dev) Tools; this flagged up that under Accessibility it didn't like the Gray text as there was not enough contrast between Gray text and a white background, so gone back to my original colour of Black. I can understand this as Black does seem easier to read now.  Pulled up few images without alt attribute, so added one, but strange that it didn't tell us to on the love running gallery and this was part of our learning material; good Lighthouse picked up on it and gave me the opportunity for more learning.

Deployment Procedure -

Frameworks/Design layout plans/Sketches -
Please see the attached photos of the above. 

Credits/References - 
The Photographs used are from four main sources:
Myself - Rachel Lawson, I own the copyright to these images, so nobody can use these without my written permission, (bird.webp, checked.webp, einstein-bird.webp, elle-hand.webp, wildlife.webp, yellow.webp). 
My partner Steve Hawkes Photography has also provided me with one image and the same copyright applies to his images(street-male.webp).
The other images were free stock images that were copyright free from www.pexels.com and one was from www.unsplash.com

No Bootstrap were used to code this website as I'd started coding the website when going through the HTML and CSS Sections and then added a little part similar to when learning the Love Running Project, as this worked well with the information I wanted to have on my website - it is purposely simple and non distracting, as the website is for beginners so it doesn't need to overly complicate anything! Plus the main purpose is to get someone to take their first photos and to book a lesson if they want to learn more.  

Extra information/Anything I would add if developing the website further - 
Learning better ways to do things more time efficiently and using a more powerful editor than replit (no offence replit, but for next project I'll try GitPod as I've found out now it's the better option).  More clarity on the project and managing the workload in a way that doesn't negatively affect my Health, as I have really struggled with this whilst on this journey. So it is a HUGE achievement to be getting this far. I also feel it is hard going back to education as an Adult learner, as you feel like you haven't done any coursework for a very long time. So setting daily and weekly SMART targets will help. Also celebrating the small accomplishments as well as the bigger ones, they all add up over time.

Thank you for spending the time looking at my README.md and my Website. I appreciate it. Hopefully you have a go at Photography too; I've been doing Photography for just under a year now and it's amazing fun, really recommend it. It's a great way to create Art, meet new people, experience new places and wildlife too. The main thing is to have fun.

Best Regards,
Rachel Lawson
