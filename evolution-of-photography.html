        <hr>
        <p> Originally cameras started off similar to the one pictured below.  It used to take a lot of time and standing very still to capture just one Photograph!  Photographs had to be developed in a 'dark room'. </p>

      <hr>
      <p>DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) Cameras were the next on the scene and made Photography a lot faster regarding processing images and you could also see the image you have taken on the back of the camera; thus providing a huge advantage for the Photographer; especially in situations where there is no room for big errors, such as Weddings, Sport and High Fashion Photoshoots. DSLR Cameras are still widely used today and most Photographers will have one.</p>
