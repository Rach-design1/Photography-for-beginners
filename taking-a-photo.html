    <p>Things to consider before taking a photo: composition, rule of thirds, leading lines, perspective, depth, make your subject pop out.</p>
          
    <h2>Take a Photo - Step by step guide</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Take off lens cap</li>
        <li>Put on lens</li>
        <li>Look through viewfinder window</li>
        <li>Check the metering bar - you want to be in the middle ideally</li>
        <li>Adjust settings as necessary (see exposure triangle)</li>
        <li>Take a test shot</li>
        <li>If needed alter settings until correctly exposed</li>
        <li>Take another test shot</li>
        <li>If happy start your shoot</li> 
        <li>Tip... Have fun and keep checking your shots, as light will change more often if outside and in a studio your position and the models to the lights can also affect the lighting back of camera!</li>
      </ol>

    <p>The Exposure Triangle is an Analogy used to explain the main elements that will affect how a Photograph is exposed. ISO, Aperature and Shutter Speed are the three elements that need to be in balance to attain a correctly exposed Photograph. </p>

    <h2>Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>
          
    <p>All Photograpy takes time to learn and practice and having fun is key. Joining a local camera club and booking onto Model Workshops where tuition is provided is a fun and safe environment to learn Photography and make new friends with the same interest!</p>
